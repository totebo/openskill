# OpenSkill
OpenSkill is a pure Lua skill rating system for the [Defold](https://www.defold.com) game engine. It is a fork of [https://github.com/bstummer/openskill.lua](https://github.com/bstummer/openskill.lua) adapted to Defold.

Although this is an extension for the Defold platform, the library should work with any pure Lua environment.
